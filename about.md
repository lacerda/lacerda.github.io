Data scientist focused on Natural Language Processing.

I have carried out research, development and deployment of ML models and NLP, as well as general devops required to run a fast, secure and reliable platform.

Broad research areas I'm interested in and have experience are Deep Learning, Natural Language Processing and Information Retrieval. Now if you're really after what intrigues me, that's latent variable models and model interpretability.

In another life I was an economist involved in finance, real estate and productivity management.

I currently work at [ROSS Intelligence][ross-url] as a Machine Intelligence Engineer.
